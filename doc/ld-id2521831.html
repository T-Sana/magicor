      This is a fast-paced puzzle game that you can play for five minutes or
      hours, depending on how much time you have and how much you like it.
      The objective is to extinguish burning fires using already blocks of
      ice, either created by the player or the game itself.
      Although learning the game physics and controls is easy, solving some of
      the levels is not.
